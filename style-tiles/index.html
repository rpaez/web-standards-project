			<h2>Insight</h2>
			<p>Burt's Bees Baby is part of an ongoing project I've been contracted to develop. I've been a consultant for the past 3 years and have worked in the field for the past 7.</p>
			<p>The style tiles created for this assignment are a good representation of what was used during project development. </p>
			<p>We initially created these using physical boards in which we attached colors; textures; fonts and anything inspirational.</p>
			<p>From there we created a brand "bible" with everything we deduced from the style board in a digital format.</p>
